Lua is a truly wonderful language - clean, small, efficient, and free
for commercial use.  It's very solid code (current version 3.1), used
in many industrial applications.  It's also well supported.
<P>
One of the things I like best about it is that I can't think of any way
to improve it.  If I had decided to write a scripting language for
myself, I doubt mine would be as good.  For the record, the original Lua
code base was generated with flex/bison or lex/yacc, and evolved from
there.  So, if you're planning on going the flex/bison route, save
yourself 3 years of refinement and use Lua.&rdquo;
